Q: What's the difference between battery technologies?
A: TIGON offers four technologies: Flooded Lead-Acid (traditional, proven), AGM (maintenance-free, vibration resistant), Gel (deep cycle optimized), and Lithium (lightweight, fast charging). Each has specific advantages for different applications.

Q: How long do TIGON batteries last?
A: Battery lifespan varies by technology and usage. Flooded batteries typically last 4-6 years, AGM and Gel 5-7 years, and Lithium 8-10 years with proper maintenance. Our experts can help optimize your battery life.

Q: Can I mix different battery types?
A: No, mixing battery types is not recommended. Use identical batteries (same voltage, capacity, technology, age) in your battery bank for optimal performance and longevity.

### Technical Support Questions
Q: How do I know when to replace my batteries?
A: Signs include reduced run time, slow charging, physical damage, or batteries over 5 years old. Our Battery Selector Quiz can help determine if replacement is needed.
